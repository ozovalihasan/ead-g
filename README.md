# ead(Entity Association Diagram gem)

## Installation

ead's installation is pretty standard:

```sh
$ gem install ead
```
## Usage

There are two choices to use the generated JSON file;
- Go to the root folder of your Ruby on Rails project.
  ```sh
  $ ead 'path_of_the_generated_file'
  ```
  * Don't forget to put quotation marks(').

- Move the generated JSON file (its name must be 'EAD.json') to the root folder of your project. Then, 
  ```sh
  $ ead
  ```
  * If the name of the generated JSON file isn't 'EAD.json',
  ```sh
  $ ead './name_of_the_file'
  ```
  * Don't forget to put quotation marks(').

‚ö†Ô∏è: Save your files before running the gem.

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è: Please double check generated files by the gem.

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è: EAD is still under development. So, it is not recommended to use this gem with ongoing projects.
